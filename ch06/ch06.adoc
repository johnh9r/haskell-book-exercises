=== 6.14 Chapter Exercises
==== Multiple choice
. c) The `*Eq*` class makes equality tests possible
. b) The typeclass `*Ord*` is a subclass of `*Eq*`
. a) Type of `*>*` is `*Ord a => a -> a -> Bool*`
. c) the type of x is a tuple in `*x = divMod 16 12*`
. a) The typeclass `*Integral*` includes `*Int*` and `*Integer*` numbers - and `Word`

. `*settleDown*`
.. inputs can be `*Woot*` or `*Blah*`
.. type error `No instance for (Num Mood) arising from the literal ‘9’` - different types and `Mood` is not in `Num`
.. `*Blah > Woot*` raises error, because `*Mood*` is not instance of `*Ord*`
. following code type checks

. Does not typecheck, `*Papu*` parameters are not well constructed.
+
[source]
----
phew = Papu "chases" True
-- fix
phew = Papu (Rocks "chases") (Yeah True)
----
. Does typecheck.
+
[source]
----
truth = Papu (Rocks "chomskydoz")
             (Yeah True)
----
. Does typecheck.
+
[source]
----
equalityForall :: Papu -> Papu -> Bool
equalityForall p p' = p == p'
----
. Does not typecheck, `*Papu*` is not an instance of `*Ord*`.

[source]
----
comparePapus :: Papu -> Papu -> Bool
comparePapus p p' = p > p'

==== Match the types
can you substitute signature

. Value `1` cannot be an needs at least `*Num*`
+
[source]
----
i :: Num a => a
i = 1

i :: a
-- No instance for (Num a) arising from the literal ‘1’
----
. Value `1.0` cannot be an instance on `*Num*`, it does not work with all the sub classes of `*Num*`. For example `1.0` cannot be `*Int*`.
+
[source]
----
f :: Float
f = 1.0

f :: Num a => a
-- error: Could not deduce (Fractional a) arising from the literal ‘1.0’ from the context (Num a)
----
. Value `1.0` works for class `Fractional` and all it's subclasses and instances, which is also `Float`
+
[source]
----
f :: Float
f = 1.0

f :: Fractional a => a
----
. Value `1.0` works for class `RealFrac` and all it's subclasses and instances.
+
[source]
----
f :: Float
f = 1.0

f :: RealFrac a => a
----
. identity function works for all values/instances of all classes
+
[source]
----
freud :: a -> a
freud x = x

freud :: Ord a => a -> a
----
. identity function works for type `*Int*`
+
[source]
----
freud' :: a -> a
freud' x = x

freud' :: Int -> Int
----
. `*myX*` is type `*Int*`, `*sigmund*` is then defined without type constraines, but the real type is `*a -> Int*` so `a -> a` breaks
+
[source]
----
myX = 1 :: Int

sigmund :: Int -> Int
sigmund x = myX

sigmund :: a -> a
----
. `*myX*` is type `*Int*`, `*sigmund'*` is then defined with `*Num*` type constrain, but the real type is `*a -> Int*` so `Num a => a -> a` breaks
+
[source]
----
myX = 1 :: Int

sigmund' :: Int -> Int
sigmund' x = myX

sigmund' :: Num a => a -> a
----
. works, `*Int*` is instance of `*Ord*` and signature of `*jung*` matches that of `*sort*`
+
[source]
----
jung :: Ord a => [a] -> a
jung xs = head (sort xs)

jung :: [Int] -> Int
----
. works, signature of `*young*` is the same as signature of `*sort*`
+
[source]
----
young :: [Char] -> Char
young xs = head (sort xs)

young :: Ord a => [a] -> a
----
. breaks, `*signifier*` is more constrained - by `*mySort*`
+
[source]
----
mySort :: [Char] -> [Char]
mySort = sort

signifier :: [Char] -> Char
signifier xs = head (mySort xs)

signifier :: Ord a => [a] -> a
----

==== Type-Kwon-Do
. we need function that does at the end `Eq a => a -> a -> Bool`, there are multiple implementation, choosing the most basic one `(==)`. we can also just ignore all the params and always return `Bool` like `True`
+
[source]
----
include::ch06_6.14_0.hs[]
----
. the trick here is to use `fromInteger` to get `Num a`. wondering how can you make more generic type from more concrete type....
